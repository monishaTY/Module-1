# Experiment No: 1e â€“ SEB-Maximum of Three Numbers

## AIM  
To write a Python program to find the minimum between three integer numbers using a conditional expression (Ternary operator).

## ALGORITHM  
1. Begin the program.  
2. Read the three numbers: `num1`, `num2`, and `num3` from the user.  
3. Compare `num1`, `num2`, and `num3` to find the smallest number:  
   - If `num1` is less than or equal to both `num2` and `num3`, then `num1` is the minimum.  
   - Else, if `num2` is less than or equal to both `num1` and `num3`, then `num2` is the minimum.  
   - Otherwise, `num3` is the minimum.  
4. Print the minimum value along with the input numbers in the format:  
   `"The minimum of num1, num2, num3 is min_num."`  
5. Terminate the program.

## PROGRAM
```python
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = int(input())

print('The maximum of', end=' ')
print(a, b, c, sep=', ', end=' ')
print('is', end=' ')

print(a if (a > b and a > c) else (b if b > c else c))

```

## RESULT
Thus, the Python program to find the maximum between three numbers using a conditional expression has been implemented and executed successfully.
