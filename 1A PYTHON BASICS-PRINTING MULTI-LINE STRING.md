# Experiment No: 1a Python Basics- Printing Multiline String

## AIM  
To create a Python program to print the string in multiple lines using triple quotes.

## ALGORITHM  
1. Begin the program.  
2. Use triple quotes (`'''` or `"""`) to define a string that spans multiple lines.  
3. Use the `print()` function to display the multi-line string.  
4. Terminate the program.

## PROGRAM
```python
# Reg.No- 212222060031
# Name- Charankumar R

string_single_quotes = '''I am a string literal
... has more than one
... line
... placed inside triple single quotes'''

string_double_quotes = """I am a string literal
... has more than one
... line
... placed inside triple double quotes"""

print(string_single_quotes)
print(string_double_quotes)
```
## OUTPUT
