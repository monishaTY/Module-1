## Experiment No: 1d â€“ Conditional Statements- Printing User Type Based on Choice

## AIM  
To Write a Python program to check whether the given character is a vowel or not using if..else statement
## ALGORITHM  
1. Begin the program.  
2. Take a character input from the user
3. Convert the character to lowercase
4. Check if the lowercase character is one of the vowels: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'
5. If it is a vowel, display "The given character is a vowel"
6. Otherwise, display "The given character is NOT a vowel"
4. Terminate the program.

## PROGRAM
```python

a = int(input())
if a == 1:
    print('Admin')
elif a == 2:
    print('Editor')
elif a == 3:
    print('Guest')
